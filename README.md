ðŸ”Ž Project Overview

MediSnap is a prescription parsing system designed to extract structured medical information from handwritten doctor prescriptions. The core objective of this system is to make medical prescriptions more readable, structured, and accessible by automatically identifying and categorizing essential details such as:

Patient information (Name, Age, Gender)

Doctor details

Date of prescription

Diagnoses / Conditions

Medications with dosage & duration

Precautions & warnings

Reminders and follow-up notes

The system processes handwritten prescription images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), applies NLP techniques to extract relevant entities, and produces a structured JSON file containing all extracted data.
