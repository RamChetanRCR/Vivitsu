    "summary": "A neck mass is a lump or swelling in the neck. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, ranging from benign (non-cancerous) to malignant (cancerous). Common causes include swollen lymph nodes, thyroid nodules, cysts, and tumors.  The exact cause requires further investigation through diagnostic testing.",
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid strenuous activities that might irritate the neck area.",
      "Monitor for any changes in the size, shape, or consistency of the mass.",
      "Report any new symptoms like pain, difficulty swallowing, or changes in voice."

  "additional_notes": "Options for further testing to determine the nature of the neck mass include biopsy (needle or excisional), ultrasound, and blood tests to assess thyroid function.  A biopsy is crucial to differentiate between benign and malignant conditions. An ultrasound can provide information about the size, shape, and location of the mass and can help guide the biopsy. Thyroid function tests are necessary to rule out thyroid disorders as a potential cause."
