    "summary": "A neck mass is a lump or swelling in the neck.  Many neck masses are benign (not cancerous), but some can be cancerous. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. The duration of the mass (2 weeks) and lack of associated symptoms like pain are positive indicators, but not definitive.",
    "precautions": [
      "Avoid manipulating or applying pressure to the mass.",
      "Monitor for changes in size, shape, or associated symptoms like pain, difficulty swallowing, or hoarseness.",
      "Follow up with the recommended diagnostic testing and specialist consultation."

  "additional_notes": "Further diagnostic testing is required to determine the nature of the neck mass. Options include fine needle aspiration biopsy, ultrasound, and/or consultation with a specialist. Based on the physician's notes, ultrasound to assess thyroid and surrounding structures seems highly probable, followed potentially by a biopsy depending on the ultrasound results."
